# S23/S23+/S23U Vulkan Rendering Tool (Linux)

A simple menu-driven Bash script to force Vulkan rendering on any Samsung Galaxy S23 variant via ADB from Linux.  
Tested by the author on S23U, and based on community recommendations, this tool may improve performance, reduce device heat, and extend battery life.  
**All changes are temporary and revert on device reboot.**

## Features

- Easy menu-driven interface with safety warnings and notices
- Forces Vulkan rendering via ADB
- Stops all apps and relaunches previously running apps and widgets
- Blacklist apps from Game Driver (based on [Reddit recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1kgnzru/comment/mr0qdd4/))
- Clear instructions and user prompts

---

## Requirements

- Linux PC
- [ADB](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) installed (usually pre-installed on most Linux distros)
      Ubuntu - (`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install android-sdk-platform-tools gawk grep coreutils`)
      Fedora/RHEL/CentOS - (`sudo dnf install android-tools gawk grep coreutils`)
- Samsung Galaxy S23/S23+/S23U
- USB Debugging enabled on your phone (`Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging`)

## Installation / How to switch to Vulkan
Clone the repository (do this once):
`git clone https://github.com/Ameen-Sha-Cheerangan/s23-ultra-vulkan-linux-script.git`

`cd s23-ultra-vulkan-linux-script`

`chmod +x opengl-to-vulkan.sh`

**Running (repeat after every device restart):**

`./opengl-to-vulkan.sh`

Follow the on-screen menu instructions.


## Uninstall / Switch Back to OpenGL

To revert your device back to OpenGL rendering, **simply restart your phone**.  
No files or settings need to be removed-rebooting the device will reset the GPU renderer to its default (OpenGL).

## Warnings

- **All changes are temporary!** Vulkan rendering will reset after a device reboot.
- **Launching all apps is NOT recommended!**  
  This may wake up background/sleeping apps and increase battery drain.
- If you do **not** relaunch all apps, some notifications from important apps may be delayed until you open them manually.
- The blacklist feature is based on a Reddit user's recommendation and may not work for everyone.

## How to Check if Vulkan is Active

To verify that Vulkan rendering is enabled:

1. **Open Developer Options** on your device.
2. **Enable GPUWatch.**
3. **Open any app** (for example, the Dialer).
4. GPUWatch will display an overlay-look for the renderer information.
   - If Vulkan is active, it will show something like: **Vulkan Renderer (skiavk)**

This is the easiest way to confirm that Vulkan is running on your Galaxy S23 device.
